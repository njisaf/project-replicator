Feature: Minimal Character Sheet for FoundryVTT

  The character sheet allows players and GMs to view and edit core character information, serving as an interactive interface for managing game-related attributes and stats. This feature supports editing character attributes, managing skills, and interacting with core game mechanics such as health and action points.
